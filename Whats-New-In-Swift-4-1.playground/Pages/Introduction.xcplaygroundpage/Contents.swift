 # What’s new in Swift 4.1

 * Created by [Paul Hudson](https://twitter.com/twostraws) – [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com)
 * Last update: April 4th 2018

 This playground is designed to showcase new features introduced with Swift 4.1. I already [wrote an article on it](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/50/whats-new-in-swift-4-1), but it's a lot more fun to see things in action and experiment yourself.

 If you hit problems or have questions, you're welcome to tweet me [@twostraws](https://twitter.com/twostraws) or email <paul@hackingwithswift.com>.

 - important: This playground requires **Xcode 9.3** or later, but if you're stuck on an older version you can [install a Swift toolchain](https://swift.org/download/) for your current Xcode version and use that instead.
